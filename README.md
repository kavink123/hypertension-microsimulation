# hypertension-microsimulation
This script performs a Monte Carlo microsimulation of hypertension (HTN) policies (Screening &amp; Adherence). It calibrates baseline HTN prevalence to a $\mathbf{30\%}$ target, models the care cascade, and computes mean/95% CI of outcomes (e.g., uncontrolled HTN) across scenarios.
